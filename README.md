# dweller-speech

This is the official repository for the speech engine powering [Dweller](https://github.com/kannachi323/dweller). 
It includes both text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) components, enabling voice interaction within the Dweller application.

## Description
Before diving into any modifications of the TTS or STT components, I recommend checking out [Dweller](https://github.com/kannachi323/dweller) to better understand its architecture and how dweller-speech fits in.

In short, Dweller is a multi-modal AI system that integrates vision, hearing, voice, and other large models to function intelligently. This repository specifically powers Dweller’s hearing and voice — enabling it to listen and speak.

Both the speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems are built on open-source models from Hugging Face, fine-tuned for improved accuracy and performance within Dweller’s ecosystem.
